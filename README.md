Web interface for [tug-overlap-checker](https://github.com/LoLei/tug-overlap-checker)

## Information
:link::earth_americas: Access the deployment [**here**](https://tug-overlap-checker.herokuapp.com). :earth_americas::link:

This is a basic web interface for 
[tug-overlap-checker](https://github.com/LoLei/tug-overlap-checker) 
which accesses its library using Flask.

Keep in mind that requests have to be loaded and rendered so 
leave the tab open to wait for the results.

The `requirements.txt` is just for the deployment, to run it 
locally only Flask is needed.
